## Questions (KPIs) and Project Insights
💡 Which card category generates highest revenue?
Insight:
* The Blue Category generates 46 M in revenue, which is 83% of total revenue.
* Other card types like Silver(6M), Gold(2M), Platinum(1M) Contribute Much less.
🔍 Business Insight:
The Blue card is the most popular or profitable among users , possibly due to wide accessibility or lower eligibility criteria.

💡 What is the revenue trend over the quarters?
Insight:
* Revenue remains fairly stable across Q1–Q4 (ranging from ₹13.3M to ₹14.2M).
* Transaction volume peaks in Q3 (166.6K), but revenue is slightly higher in Q2 and Q3.
🔍 Business Insight:
While transaction volume is highest in Q3, the average transaction value may be higher in Q2. Marketing strategies for Q3 should focus on higher-value transactions.

💡 Which job segments are the most profitable?
Insight:
* Businessmen (₹17M) and White-collar professionals (₹10M) generate the highest revenue.
* Others like Govt and Self-employed contribute around ₹8M.
🔍 Business Insight:
These two segments should be prioritized in premium card offers and upselling strategies.

💡 How does revenue differ by education level?
Insight:
* Graduates contribute the most (₹22M), followed by High School (₹11M), and Post-Grads (~₹3M).
* Revenue is low from Doctorate holders (₹2M).
